# OfficeManagement
This is a simple Hierarchy Management System to be used by employees of an organisation to see what position have they been assigned to and who are their direct as well as indirect reports. There are two modules in this comprising of a User module and an Admin module. Employees can register, login and view/edit their own profile as well as the hierarchy of people under them. They can upload their profile picture and edit the other personal information. Admin apart from login, can view the list of all employees as well as has permission to assign or unassign a position in the position hierarchy to any employee.
